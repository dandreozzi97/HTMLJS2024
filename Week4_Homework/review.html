        <p>
            I present an interest in the movie "Interstellar" because I think it's an extremely well directed portrayal of the universe. The visuals along with the science supporting behind it are almost the perfect mix. The movie almost becomes an art piece at this point with the story concepts of love and passion.

            Matthew McConaughey plays as a very serious character in this movie unlike most of his past roles.  From intense scenes of crying to monologues, he took the genres drama and mystery head on and destroyed it with flying colors.

            Also, who doesn't want to see the (synthetic) universe on film?

            <h3>Trivia</h3>
            <ul>

                    Trivia Fact 1: Dr. Kip Thorne and Double Negative's team collaborated on CGI simulations of wormholes and black holes using theoretical equations. The rendering process took up to 100 hours per frame, totaling 800 terabytes of data. Thorne's insights led to scientific papers for astrophysics and computer graphics communities.

                <li>
                    Trivia Fact 2: Dr. Kip Thorne established two rules for the movie: stick to known physical laws and base speculative elements on science. Christopher Nolan agreed, as long as it didn't hinder filmmaking. Despite this, there were clashes, including a two-week discussion to dissuade Nolan from an idea involving faster-than-light travel.

                <li>
                    Trivia Fact 3: For a cornfield scene, Christopher Nolan sought to grow five hundred acres of corn, which he learned was feasible from his producing of Man of Steel (2013). The corn was then sold, and actually made a profit.
