        <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Domenic Andreozzi</strong>. I was born on <em>July 22, 2005</em> in Providence, RI although I grew up in Johnston and Scituate. I spent half of my childhood in <b>Johnston</b>, moving to a second house within that time frame. Once I passed third grade, my parents thought it would be a smarter idea to move to Scituate since it's quieter and more traditional. So, I moved into my third house in <i>North Scituate</i>. I spent two years there before moving to my fourth house which is technically on the Scituate/Foster line. I stayed in this house for about 6 years until my parents divorced and I moved in with my mom full time in Clayville (there was a time where she lived in Warwick and I alternated). Within all of these moves I graduated from Scituate High School while being in the National Honor Society. During high school (post covid) I joined the tennis team and graduated while being 4th singles in my second year. After high school I came here to NEIT for Cybersecurity and Network Engineers.
